Vehicle  detection  and  tracking  applications  play  an  important  role  for  civilian  and  military  applications such as in highway traffic surveillance control, management and urban traffic planning. Vehicle detection process  on  road  are  used  for  vehicle  tracking,  counts,  average  speed  of  each  individual  vehicle,  traffic analysis  and  vehicle  categorizing  objectives  and  may  be  implemented  under  different  environments changes.  In  this  review,  we  present  a  concise  overview  of  image  processing  methods  and  analysis  tools which used in building these previous mentioned applications that involved developing traffic surveillance systems.  More  precisely  and  in  contrast  with  other reviews,  we  classified  the  processing  methods  underthree categories for more clarification to explain the traffic systems
